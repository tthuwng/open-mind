Mental health is always an alarming and significant problem, especially in this era where there are tons of distractions and horrible things happening around us, both in the real world and digital world. Thus it is more important than ever that we should focus on our mental health.

- 1 in 10 young people experienced a period of major depression
- Since 2013, millennials have seen a 47% increase in major-depression diagnoses

Our team wanted to build a speech-to-text therapy app that helps detect your mental health and give advice based on your emotions and mind state.

Basically it records your thoughts about the day and the app will detect and give the results of the percentage of different kinds of moods with charts and weekly statistics. Then give the users advice based on emotions
